FLTHDR

	Utility to view and modify bFLT file properties.

READBFLT
	
	Like readelf, but for bFLT files. Provides a bit more info on relocation and global offset tables than flthdr.

BFLTLDR
	
	A bFLT v4 loader for IDA Pro. If the bFLT file is compressed, first decompress it with flthdr before loading into IDA.
